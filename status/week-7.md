# Report for Week 7

## What went right

* Set up a [repository](https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/klasseg/cda-codegen). for working with the code-generation 
* Merged notes with the report, and added more text to the abstract & introduction.
* Read parts of the Scala book/cookbook.
* Had another discussion with Paris & Lars to clarify how work should be split between Oscar and I.
* Had interesting discussions with the Rust and Scala communities about transpilers, parsers and other stuff.
* Found a couple more papers with Christian's forward-search method.
* Discovered IntelliJ language injection, Rust grammars, and the TeaVM, which might be useful for the thesis.

## What went wrong

* Oscar and I accidentally worked on each others parts, but this was cleared up after the meeting.

## Plan for next week

* Write about external DSLs, quasi-quotes, grammars, lexer/parser combinators/generators, IntelliJ language injection, WebAssembly, and transpilers.
* Create a basic AST data structure in Scala.
