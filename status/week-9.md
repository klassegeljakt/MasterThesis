# Report for Week 9

## What went right

* Had a brief meeting with Lars & Paris to verify that things were going in the right direction. They were satisfied with what I have accomplished so far. The feedback I got was that I should focus on quality over quantity when it comes to the AST.
* Experimented with the Shapeless library to see if there are any other features than Heterogeneous lists which could be useful for the code generator.
* Finished implementing the Item Declaration prototypes, and started working on implementing the Emit function for nodes in the AST.
* Wrote about Spark, Quasi-quotes, IntelliJ Language Injection, String Interpolation, and Quasi Quotes.

## What went wrong

* I think I could have written more. Currently, I feel like I am ahead of schedule on the implementation and behind on the report writing.

## Plan for next week

* Focus on writing. Try to produce a first draft by the end of next week. The things to write about are:
  * Background: Scala & The Shapeless Library (1-2 pages)
  * Design: An overview of how the code generator fits into the system, and how the AST is designed. Add figures for these parts. (1-2 pages)
  * Implementation: How Scala & Shapeless are used to implement the various AST nodes. Don't describe all nodes since many nodes are basically the same. (1-2 pages)
  * Evaluation: Evaluate the code generator with regards to the design goals, and provide a short test. (1-2 pages)
  * Conclusion: Preliminary conclusions & future work (<1 page)
