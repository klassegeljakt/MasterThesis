# Report for Week 15

## Achievements

* Implementation: Squashed some bugs and polished the code.
* Report: Wrote on the implementation and background. Refactored the background so it is now four sections instead of three:
  Background:
   1. Domain Specific Languages
   2. The Rust Programming Language
   3. The Scala Programming Language
   4. Design Patterns for Scala DSLs

## Issues

## Plan for next week

* Implementation: Re-implement structs on top of records from the Shapeless library. This will decrease the verbosity of DSL code by a great deal.
* Report: Keep on writing.
