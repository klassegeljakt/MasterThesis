# Report for Week 18

## Achievements

* Implementation: Found a new superior way to writing functions and structs, and implemented it.
* Report: Wrote on implementation, and design, and refactored the background.

## Issues

* No issues, just need to speed up the writing.

## Plan for next week

* Implementation: The implementation is finished, just need to document it.
* Report: Finish writing the design+implementation+evaluation. Then check if there is something missing from the background.
