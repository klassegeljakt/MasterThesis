# Report for Week 3

## What was accomplished

* Read/took notes of the following papers (also re-read some papers):
  * *Language Virtualization for Heterogeneous Parallel Computing*
  * *Paxos Made Switch-y*
* Had more discussions with Oscar about the CDA problem and possible solutions
* Setup tools and started coding in Rust as a side project to get better at the language
* Wrote on Problem, Benefits/Ethics/Sustainability, Related Work, Delimitations
* Got new ideas about CDA (maybe not feasible for this thesis), will discuss them at the meeting at the end of this month

## What did not go according to plan

* Some parts of the thesis are still ambiguous to me.
  * Need to know what type of code generator is preferred:
    * External or embedded?
    * Shallow or deep embedding?
    * Polymorphic embedding?
    * Lightweight modular staging?
  * Need to know more about how the system as a whole will work.

## Plan for next week

* Have a meeting with Lars and Paris to ask questions
* Read more papers, specifically:
  * *Weld: Rethinking the Interface Between Data-Intensive Libraries*
  * *Voodoo - A Vector Algebra for Portable Database Performance on Modern Hardware*
* Attend the CSL presentation on Tuesday
