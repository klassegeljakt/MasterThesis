# Report for Week 10 (Halfway)

## What went right

* Wrote about the Expression Problem, and Scala in the background.
* Refactored the introduction to make the red thread more apparent.
* Added figures and tables to the introduction and background.
* Started on the design and implementation.

## What went wrong

* Had to go to job meetings on Thursday & Friday (SAAB & Scania) which interrupted the workflow.
* The report is shaping up, but probably not yet in a state where it could be considered a first draft since the evaluation is missing.

## Plan for next week

* Continue writing on the design/implementation. Add information about parsers, lexers and ASTs to the background. Refactor the problem section, since there is unneeded text there. Fix the broken sources, and make sure there are no missing citations.
* Coordinate with Oscar to merge our code.
* Create tests to evaluate performance and typechecking.
