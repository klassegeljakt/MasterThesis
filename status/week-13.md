# Report for Week 13

## Achievements

* Implementation: Implemented structs and reimplemented functions. Also implemented if / if-else, while, loop.
* Report: Integrated notes about Scala, and IntelliJ, and added more entries to the related work section. Also wrote about the Rust compiler.

## Issues

* Being able to declare custom structs might not turn out to be very useful. As Lars pointed out, CDA will mostly use structs from other libraries. Therefore it would be useful to generate a "facade" to other libraries (standard and external), similar to forward-declarations in C.

## Plan for next week

* Implementation: Add support for traits and keep investigating in ways to implement pattern matching. Create a Rust program in syn for generating "facades" to Rust libraries.
* Report: Keep writing about Rust + implementation + design.
