## What did not go according to plan

* The cold I got last week was worse than I expected so I stayed home this week and focused on reading papers.
* After reading a lot of papers, I realized how big this area is. I need to take some time to structure my thoughts before I can finish the introduction.

## Plan for next week

* Read more papers, specifically:
  * *Language Virtualization for Heterogeneous Parallel Computing*
  * *Weld: Rethinking the Interface Between Data-Intensive Libraries*
  * *Voodoo - A Vector Algebra for Portable Database Performance on Modern Hardware*
* Continue work on the report, the background should be finished before the end of February.
* Finish one slide for the 2-minute pitch presentation in 2 weeks.
