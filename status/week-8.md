# Report for Week 8

## What went right

* Implemented a majority of the constructs for the AST data structure.
* Implemented static type checking using heterogeneous lists from the Shapeless Scala library (recommended by Lars).

## What went wrong

* Did not write much about what was originally planned in last week's status report, and instead focused on writing about the Rust programming language and the introduction.

## Plan for next week

* Write about the topics planned last week.
* Implement the remaining constructs (Item declarations) for the AST.
* Create tests to see how well the type checking works.
* Ask Paris and Lars if this is a desirable design and implementation before starting to write about those parts in the report.
