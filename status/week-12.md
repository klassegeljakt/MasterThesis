# Report for Week 12

## Achievements

* Implementation: Managed to implement higher order generics, so you can write generic Rust functions in the DSL.Functions without generics support multiple arguments. Functions with generics support multiple generics, but currently not multiple arguments, but this should be solveable.
* Report: Wrote mainly about Scala and took notes about the Rust compiler.

## Issues

* The generics took a lot of time to implement, so the report did not see as much progress as was planned.

## Plan for next week

* Implementation: Combine the generics with Shapeless, so the user can pass multiple arguments to functions which are type checked against the generics. Afterwards, get started on higher order structs.
* Report: Integrate notes about Rust. Continue writing about Scala, specifically the design patterns. Also write on the design + implementation, based on what has been implemented so far.
