# Report for Week 1

## What was accomplished

* Did an opposition for Pietro Cannalire's defence this Thursday who is one of Vlad's master thesis students.
* Lars proposed a thesis separation.
  * His proposal can be viewed here: https://gist.github.com/Bathtor/5b64bd9b296b464b062091667f4a4947
  * I will do the first part (interpret IR to AST).
  * Oscar will do the second part (generate Rust code from AST + compilation).
  * It is all subject to change, and more work could be added if either part is too easy.
* Finished reading the following papers/books/documentations:
  * *Shallow Embedding of DSLs via Online Partial Evaluation*
  * *The Rust Programming Language 2*
* Current status on report:
  * Setup the infrastructure for writing the report (Pandoc Markdown + BibTex).
  * The report has no content yet, but I have taken notes from the and discussions, the paper and documentation.

## What did not go according to plan

* The opposition and a cold took away time from the thesis. I planned to read more papers and put more effort into the report.

## Plan for next week

* Current reading list:
  * *Polymorphic embedding of DSLs*
  * *Concealing the deep embedding of DSLs*
  * *Modular Domain Specific Languages and Tools*
  * *The Scala Programming Language*
* Find more papers.
* Finish a rough first draft of the Introduction section of the report.
* Coordinate with Oscar to come up with the AST definition, and IR requirements.
